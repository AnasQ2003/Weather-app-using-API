# Weather-app-using-API
To understand how to use APIs (Application Programming Interfaces) to retrieve data from external sources such as weather and location services. The goal was to connect Python with real-time data systems and interpret the returned information.
‚úÖ Objective:
To understand how to use APIs (Application Programming Interfaces) to retrieve data from external sources such as weather and location services. The goal was to connect Python with real-time data systems and interpret the returned information.

üîç Activities Performed:
Connected to OpenWeatherMap API to fetch real-time weather data based on city input.

Used ipinfo.io API to detect the user‚Äôs current IP-based location.

Integrated Nominatim (geopy) for geocoding functionality.

üí° Key Concepts Learned:
Constructing and sending HTTP requests using the requests library.

Receiving and decoding JSON-formatted responses.

Extracting specific data fields (e.g., temperature, weather condition) from nested JSON objects.

‚ö†Ô∏è Challenges:
Understanding JSON hierarchy and key-paths for nested data.

Handling request errors like invalid responses or connectivity issues.

üß† Reflections:
This week introduced a real-world context to Python programming. The ability to fetch dynamic data made the experience practical and highly engaging. It demonstrated Python‚Äôs strength in handling web communication.

‚úÖ APIs
‚Ä¢	The code interacts with the OpenWeatherMap API.
‚Ä¢	It also makes an API request to ipinfo.io 
‚Ä¢	The Nominatim API from geopy is used for geocoding 
‚úÖ JSON Parsing
‚Ä¢	The API responses from OpenWeatherMap and ipinfo.io return JSON data.
‚Ä¢	The code extracts specific information using data = response.json() and accesses values like data["main"]["temp"], data["weather"][0]["description"], etc.
‚úÖ Error Handling
‚Ä¢	The try-except blocks handle possible errors when fetching weather data (get_weather(city)), detecting location (detect_location()), and updating the map (update_map(city)).
‚Ä¢	If an error occurs (e.g., network issues, invalid city input), it catches the exception and updates the UI with a meaningful message.
‚úÖ Libraries like requests
‚Ä¢	The requests library is used for making HTTP requests to APIs.
‚Ä¢	It helps fetch weather data, detect the user's IP-based location, and retrieve JSON responses from APIs.
